	Welcome! You have stumbled onto Ed's personal homepage.
	In my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> you will find some paper's and algorithms that piqued my interest enough that I implemented them and attempted to write up an instructive outline.
	The <a href="/notes.html">notes</a> page collates summaries of some courses I am working through at my leisure. The full <a href="http://github.com/ewal31/mysite">source code</a> and
	any partially written posts is available on github.
